HackTheSystem: 
add one flag to your own name. student object to your array
if the hacker value is there and then you should know. 
use push to add yourself as a student 
the system needs to know its hacked: sovle this by a global flag that says system is hacked = true 
inquisitorial squard: when button clicked - if flag is up, then we add timer that removes the inquisitorial property of object and turn it into false 
the bloodstatus is no longer trustworthy: iterate throught the whole bloodstatus by a loop, if pure blood we make a math random from an array and index of array
